![Meowspace Wireframe]()


This drawings is called a wireframe. Wireframes are like a blueprint for your site's layout design. It highlights the layout without focusing on any of the design specifics (like color, fonts etc.).


**You can make only make limited changes to the HTML**
  - WITHOUT moving any content around
  - You can add sectioning elements, ID's and classes as necessary

## Primary Requirements

- Add normalize.css  
- Use CSS to rearrange the layout to match the drawings as much as possible (it doesn't need to be perfect). You should utilize the following layout techniques at least once:
  - Inline Block display
  - Floats
  - Fixed Positioning
-  Identify repeated style, use CSS selectors and class/id names to organize and DRY your code.
- Add a custom styling
  - At least one google font
  - At least one pseudo selector (like hover)


### Optional Enhancements
